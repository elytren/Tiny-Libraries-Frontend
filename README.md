#Technologies Used

Written with Python, Django, React, CSS, Postgresql

#Problems

I really struggled with Google Maps API there were so many npm packages for react and the one I ended up using kind of limited my google maps usage. 

#MVP 

As a user 
-I want to know what the app is about
-I want to know how to use the app
-I want to be able to see libraries near me
-I want to be able to get directions from any location to any given library 
-I want to be able to add, and delete libraries
-I want to be able to see details about the libraries 

#Stretch Goals

-As a user I want to log into a well designed website
-As a user I want to be able to get directions from the map in the app
-As a user I want to be able to login and favorite libraries I frequent
